# Edit Layout

Click on "Start Editing" to explore the layout editing experience.

## Resizing and Dragging
The widgets can be resized by dragging on the bottom-right corner,
or the right or bottom edges. Draggin anywhere else will move the widget.

## Changing the Widget
Each widget has a title bar with a dropdown to change the widget type.

### Required Widget
A widget can be defined as required in the Scene.
If so, there should be no way to remove the last instance of it by editing the layout:

- The dropdown is disabled
- The close button is disabled
- If it goes out of screen, the layout should reset to the previous step.

## Removing a Widget
Click on the close button on the top-right corner of the widget to remove it.

## Adding Widgets
Widgets reproduce by splitting. You can split a widget
either vertically or horizontally. The new widget will have no content
by default, until you select one from the dropdown.

When exiting editing mode, unselected widgets are removed.
