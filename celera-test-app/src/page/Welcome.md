# Welcome

This is the documentation and testing app of Celera - the
in-house widget UI framework for my apps.

It allows the app to define scenes and widgets, and gives the
user the ability to customize the layout.

It is a wrapper built upon:
- [`react`](https://react.dev/) - UI library
- [`react-grid-layout`](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout) - Grid layout library for React
- [`@fluentui/react-components`](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui) - Microsoft's React component library
- [`@pistonite/pure`](https://github.com/Pistonite/pure) - In-house pure TypeScript utility library for my apps
